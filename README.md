# Graph-Sample-and-Aggregate-Attention-Network-for-Hyperspectral-Image-Classification
DOI: 10.1109/LGRS.2021.3062944 Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has shown potential in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, GCN is a transductive learning method, which is difficult to aggregate the new node. And the available GCN-based methods fail to understand the global and contextual information of the graph. To address this deficiency, a novel semisupervised network based on graph sample and aggregate-attention (SAGE-A) for HSIs classification is proposed. Different from the graph convolution neural network (GCN) based method, SAGE-A adopts a multi-level graph sample and aggregate (graphSAGE) network, as it can flexibly aggregate the new neighbor node among arbitrarily structured non-Euclidean data and capture long-range contextual relations. Inspired by the convolution neural network (CNN) self-attention mechanism, the proposed network employs the graph attention mechanism to characterize the importance among spatially neighboring regions, so the deep contextual and global information of the graph can be learned automatically by focusing on important spatial targets. Extensive experimental results on different real hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the performances of our proposed method compared with state-of-the-art methods.  Index Termsâ€”Hyperspectral image classification, graph convolution neural network, global and contextual information.
